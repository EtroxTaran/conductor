# Project Context

This file captures developer preferences and project-specific decisions.
It is generated during the discussion phase and used by workers during implementation.

## Library Preferences

List specific libraries to use or avoid:
- Example: Use date-fns instead of moment.js
- Example: Prefer axios over fetch
- Example: Use zod for schema validation

## Architectural Decisions

Describe the architectural patterns to follow:
- Example: Repository pattern for data access
- Example: Service layer for business logic
- Example: Feature-based folder structure

## Testing Philosophy

Define testing requirements and preferences:
- Example: Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Example: Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Example: Maintain 80% code coverage for business logic

## Code Style

Code style preferences beyond linting rules:
- Example: Prefer early returns over nested conditions
- Example: Use named exports instead of default exports
- Example: Keep functions under 50 lines

## Error Handling

How errors should be handled:
- Example: Use custom error classes with error codes
- Example: Log errors with full context
- Example: Use Result types for expected failures

## Additional Notes

Any other relevant information for implementation:
- Example: This project requires Node.js 18+
- Example: All dates should be stored in UTC
